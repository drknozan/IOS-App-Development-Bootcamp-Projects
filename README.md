# iOS App Development Bootcamp Projects

This repo contains the apps and challenges I completed while taking "iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" course by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy.

> User chooses one of the three different egg types. There is three different button "Soft" "Medium" and "Hard". All types are stored in dictionary with boiling times. Scheduled timer starts when user clicks one of the buttons. The progress bar starts to fill every second depending on how much time there is left to reach chosen time. When the time is up, alarm will sound. AVFoundation framework is used to play the alarm sound.
